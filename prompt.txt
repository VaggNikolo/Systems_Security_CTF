This assignment contains a mock Web application with a back-end database, consisting of two
tables, namely “users” and “items”. The application supports the following functionalities:
● Login as a simple user (username: “user”).
● Search for items based on their name and display their information.
● Login as an administrator (username: “superadmin”).
● View files.
● Logout.

The application, however, also contains six distinct vulnerabilities:
● Two separate SQL injection vulnerabilities.
● A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
● A DOM-XSS vulnerability.
● A local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability.
● An open redirect vulnerability.

Tasks
1. Bypass the initial login page using an SQL injection payload and login as “user”.
2. Identify and exploit the DOM-XSS vulnerability.
3. Identify and exploit the reflected XSS vulnerability.
4. Misuse the item search functionality to retrieve data from the “users” DB table and
acquire the admin’s password.
5. Login in as the administrator.
6. Identify and exploit the open redirection vulnerability by triggering a redirect to
http://example.com/.
7. Identify and exploit the LFI vulnerability to find the secret flag.

The application will be running under `http://127.0.0.1:8080`

1. The application has three pages:
	a. User login: “/”
		i.User dashboard and search: “/dashboard”
	b. Admin login and dashboard: “/admin”
	The dashboard is inaccessible unless you first login as a user.
2. It is highly recommended to study the provided source code and understand the
application’s logic. However, the passwords and the flag are fake. You will need to
retrieve them from the real application (see note #1). The credentials
(username:password) for the mock application are:
	a. user:user
	b. superadmin:superadmin
3. The XSS payloads can be anything you want, as long as it is executable JavaScript
code, e.g., alert(“xyz”).
5. If you want to reset your session and progress, delete the “session” cookie and refresh
your browser.
6. When you have exploited all vulnerabilities locally, try your payloads in the real server.
7. You only need to provide the password to login; usernames are set automatically.
8. The two database tables and their structure are attached:

I have attached the files of the source code that you need to examine aswell.
